# Challenge-One

## Challenge Description

This challenge was to convert div tags in the html code of a webpage to semantic tags. The purpose of converting these tags into semantic html is to increase user accessibility. Semantic html is funcionally the same as using div tags, but it is much more descriptive. If a person were to have the webpage read to them with an accessibility device, semantic html would allow the user to know what seection or element of the page they are experiencing.
